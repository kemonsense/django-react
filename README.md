# django-react

This is a Django-React-Redux based web app.

To run the app follow this steps:

1. make a virtual environment (for me like: mkvirtualenv dj-react or workon dj-react)
2. Intall all the dependencies and dev dependencies from `requirements.txt` and from `package.json` file
3. In root folder run `python manage.py runserver` to run backend server
4. In root folder run `npm run dev` to run frontend in a new deferent terminal
